sciplot
=======

scilab-style plot for python

Purpose
~~~~~~~~

The goal of the package is to :

- mimic ``scilab`` basic ploting functions,

- ease life of starters learning both ``scilab`` and python,

- be so simple that all starters can contribute to extend it, or do their own version.

Non-goal of the package :

- mimicing exactly all scilab ploting functions,

- avoiding any easy enhancements over ``scilab`` function.

Method 
~~~~~~~

The project is a simplification layer over Python Scientific Package, especially matplotlib.

Usage 
~~~~~~~
Should be easy to load from any ipython cell anywhere :
%load https://raw.github.com/stonebig/sciplot/master/(a_file).py

Should be easy to import as a module of your starter project.
import (a_file).py
